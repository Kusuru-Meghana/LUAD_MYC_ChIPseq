# Peak Annotation Results

This folder contains gene-level annotation of MYC ChIP-seq peaks.

### Files
- **MYC_A549_peak_annotations.csv**  
  Annotated peaks mapped to closest genes, genomic regions, and TSS distances.

- **MYC_A549_peak_annotation_plots.pdf**  
  ChIPseeker visualization including:
  - genomic feature distribution
  - distance-to-TSS plot
  - annotation bar plots

These results identify where MYC binds (promoters, enhancers, introns, intergenic) in A549 cells.
