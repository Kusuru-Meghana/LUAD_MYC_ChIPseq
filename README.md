LUAD MYC ChIP-seq: Mapping MYC Binding Sites in Lung Adenocarcinoma (A549)

End-to-end ChIP-seq analysis of MYC regulatory networks in lung cancer

🚀 Overview

This project performs a complete ChIP-seq pipeline to identify genome-wide binding sites of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC in A549 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells.
Using ENCODE-matched replicates (2 MYC + 2 IgG controls), the analysis recovers:

High-confidence MYC binding peaks

Direct MYC-regulated oncogenes

Key LUAD pathways controlled by MYC

Peak annotation, motif enrichment, and pathway biology

This project demonstrates both bioinformatics workflow skills and cancer genomics interpretation, suitable for bioinformatics roles, computational biology internships, and junior scientist positions.

🧬 Biological Motivation

MYC is a master regulator of tumor growth. In LUAD, MYC drives:

Ribosome biogenesis

Protein synthesis

Metabolic rewiring

Cell-cycle progression

Stress and survival signaling

Goal:

Identify where MYC binds the genome in A549 cells, and what biological programs MYC directly regulates.

📁 Data Summary
Condition	Replicates	Description
MYC ChIP	2	MYC-bound DNA fragments
IgG Control	2	Background noise

All datasets originate from a single ENCODE ChIP-seq experiment.

🛠 Pipeline
1. QC (FastQC + MultiQC)

Q-scores: 35–40 (excellent)

GC content: ~41–43%

Duplicate rate: low (4–18%)

No adapters → no trimming needed

2. Alignment (Bowtie2 → hg38)

26–31 million reads per sample

High alignment rate

Sorted + indexed BAMs used for peak calling

3. Peak Calling (MACS2)
macs2 callpeak -t MYC.bam -c IgG.bam -g hs -f BAM -n MYC


Results:

~5,000+ MYC peaks

Enrichment up to 40×

Summits used for motif analysis

4. Peak Annotation (ChIPseeker)

~50% promoter peaks

~935 MYC-bound genes

5. Enrichment Analysis (GSEApy + Enrichr)

rRNA processing

Macromolecule biosynthesis

Peptide biosynthetic process

→ MYC activates biosynthetic and proliferative programs.

🔥 4. GO Molecular Function

RNA binding

mRNA 5′-UTR binding

rRNA binding

snoRNA binding

Cadherin binding

→ MYC regulates post-transcriptional control & adhesion.

🔥 5. GO Cellular Component

Nucleolus

Ribosomal subunits

Small-subunit processome

Focal adhesions

→ MYC activates nucleolar, translational, and migration modules.

🔥 6. KEGG Pathway Enrichment

Most enriched pathways:

Ribosome (84 genes)

Ribosome biogenesis

RNA transport

Purine metabolism

PI3K/AKT & insulin signaling

Ferroptosis

Spliceosome

→ MYC controls metabolic, proliferative, and stress-survival pathways.

🧠 Final Biological Interpretation

In A549 LUAD cells, MYC directly binds and activates a multi-layer regulatory program that drives tumor progression.
MYC controls:

Growth signaling (EGFR, STAT3, FOSL1)

Cell-cycle progression (CDK4, CCND1, WEE1)

Metabolic rewiring (HK2, LDHA, FASN)

Ribosome & translation machinery (hundreds of RPL/RPS/EIF genes)

RNA processing & splicing

Ferroptosis regulators

Stress and DNA-repair programs

This represents a canonical, MYC-driven LUAD regulatory state.
